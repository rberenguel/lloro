## Why not…

### Why didn't you use the Gemini API like a normal person?

I didn't want to deal with the API, to be fair. I already have gemini-cli installed, with an acceptable
free tier + the access I get for Gemini Pro, so… This gets it done without dealing with the API. Which I
did not want to deal with. Feel free to fork and add that if you feel like it, no problem!

## What's New in v0.1.0

- **🎯 Smart Pinning**: Pages are no longer sent by default - click the pin button to opt-in
- **📌 Pin Permanence**: Pinned pages cannot be unpinned within a session (AI already has the context)
- **🗂️ Multi-Session Management**: Create, switch between, and delete multiple conversation sessions
- **🔄 Tab Awareness**: Extension tracks which tab you're viewing and updates pin state accordingly
- **📊 Session History**: View all sessions with metadata (message count, pins, model, date)
- **🔁 Auto-Migration**: Automatically upgrades from v0.0.1 single-session format
- **💾 Better Storage**: Each session maintains its own pins, messages, and model selection

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) installed and authenticated
- Chrome/Chromium browser

### Gemini CLI Setup

1. Install the latest version of Gemini CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
   ```

2. Authenticate:

   ```bash
   gemini
   ```

3. (Optional) Enable Gemini 3 preview models:
   ```bash
   gemini settings
   ```
   Navigate to model settings and enable the preview models if you want access to `gemini-3-flash-preview` and `gemini-3-pro-preview`.

## How It Works

The backend spawns `gemini --experimental-acp` as a subprocess and communicates with it using the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) (JSON-RPC over stdio). This maintains a persistent session with conversation history, so you can have multi-turn conversations about page content.

### Key Features

- **Session Management**: Create and manage multiple conversation sessions, each with its own history and context
- **Smart Page Pinning**: Opt-in to send page content - click the pin button to extract and include current page content
- **Tab-Aware Context**: Pin multiple tabs per session, automatically tracks which tab you're viewing
- **Pin Permanence**: Once a page is pinned in a session, it cannot be unpinned (the AI already has the context)
- **Session History**: Navigate between previous sessions, delete old ones, see session metadata
- **Auto-Migration**: Automatically migrates from old single-session format to new multi-session storage

## Setup

### 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:6363`. Endpoints:

- `POST /rpc` - JSON-RPC endpoint
- `GET /health` - Health check

### 2. Load the Chrome Extension

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `extension/` directory

### 3. Use the Extension

1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar to open the side panel (or press `Ctrl+Period`)
2. Select a model from the dropdown (default: gemini-3-flash-preview)
3. Navigate to any webpage
4. **Optional**: Click the 📌 pin button to extract and include current page content
   - By default, pages are NOT sent to save tokens
   - Once pinned, the page content will be sent with your next message
   - Pinned pages cannot be unpinned in the same session
5. Type a question and press Enter
6. Use the "+" button to start a new conversation (clears all pins)
7. Use the "☰" button to view, switch between, or delete previous sessions

## Features Explained

### Pin Management

- **Default Behavior**: Pages are NOT automatically sent to the AI (to save tokens and prevent large context)
- **Pinning a Page**: Click the 📌 pin button to extract the current page's content
  - Uses Readability.js for intelligent article extraction
  - Falls back to manual DOM extraction if Readability fails
  - Content is stored and will be sent with your next chat message
- **Pin Permanence**: Once a page is pinned and its content sent to the AI, it cannot be unpinned
  - This is because the AI's context already includes the page
  - The pin button becomes disabled and shows as "permanent"
  - Starting a new session clears all pins
- **Multiple Tabs**: You can pin multiple tabs in a single session
  - Each tab's content is tracked separately
  - Context bar shows how many tabs are pinned and which need to be sent
  - Format: "📌 Current page • N to send" or "N sent"

### Session Management

- **Multiple Sessions**: Create and manage unlimited conversation sessions
  - Each session has its own message history
  - Each session has its own set of pinned pages
  - Each session is locked to a specific AI model
- **Session List**: Click the ☰ button to view all sessions
  - Shows: message count, pinned page count, model, creation date
  - Active session is highlighted
  - Sessions sorted by most recently active
- **Session Switching**: Click any session in the list to switch to it
  - Restores all messages and pin states
  - Updates model selector to match session's model
- **Delete Sessions**: Click the × button on any session to delete it
  - Confirmation required
  - If you delete the active session, automatically switches to next most recent
  - If no sessions remain, creates a new one
- **New Session**: Click the + button to start fresh
  - Clears all messages
  - Clears all pinned pages
  - Uses currently selected model

### Tab Awareness

- **Automatic Tracking**: Extension monitors which tab you're viewing
  - Updates pin button state based on current tab
  - Shows if current tab is already pinned
- **Tab Switching**: When you switch tabs:
  - Pin button updates to reflect new tab's pin state
  - Context bar shows if current tab is pinned
  - Previously pinned tabs remain in session memory
- **Per-Tab Pin State**: Each tab URL is tracked independently
  - Same URL on different tabs = same pin state
  - Different URLs = different pin states
  - Pin states persist within a session

### On-device Fallback

If Chrome has downloaded the Gemini Nano model, a `gemini-nano (on-device)` option appears in the model dropdown. You can select it explicitly, or it activates automatically in two cases:

- **Backend offline at startup** — if the health check fails and Nano is available, the dropdown switches to it silently.
- **RPC call fails mid-conversation** — quota errors, network drops, etc. A note appears in the chat and the session continues locally.

A few things to keep in mind:

- **No backend required** when using on-device. Inference runs entirely in the browser via Chrome's [Prompt API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai).
- **Ephemeral context**: the model's conversation memory lives only as long as the side panel stays open. Close and reopen it and your messages still render from storage, but the model doesn't remember them.
- Pinned-page context works the same as with remote models: baked into the session on first use, new pins mid-conversation get prepended to your message. When multiple pages are pinned, their content is automatically summarized (via Chrome's [Summarizer API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/summarizer-api)) before being sent to Nano — keeps things inside its context window. Single-page context is sent as-is.

See [Gemini Nano won't download](#gemini-nano-wont-download--not-enough-space) in Troubleshooting if you can't get the model to install.

## JSON-RPC API

### InitSession

Initializes or resets the Gemini CLI agent with a specific model.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "InitSession",
  "params": { "model": "gemini-3-flash-preview" }
}
```

### Chat

Sends a message with optional page context to the agent.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "Chat",
  "params": {
    "message": "Summarize this article",
    "context": "Page content here..."
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `PORT` - Backend server port (default: 6363)

### Available Models

- `gemini-3-flash-preview` (default)
- `gemini-3-pro-preview`
- `gemini-2.5-flash`
- `gemini-2.5-pro`
- `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
- `gemini-nano (on-device)` — appears automatically if Chrome has the Nano model downloaded; see [On-device Fallback](#on-device-fallback) below

## Troubleshooting

### Backend shows "ACP initialize failed, falling back to non-interactive mode"

This usually means the Gemini CLI version doesn't support ACP or there's an authentication issue:

1. Update Gemini CLI: `npm update -g @google/gemini-cli`
2. Re-authenticate: `gemini`
3. Check that `gemini --experimental-acp` works in your terminal

### Backend shows "failed to start gemini-cli"

Ensure `gemini` CLI is installed and in your PATH:

```bash
which gemini
gemini --version
```

### Extension shows "Backend offline"

1. Verify the backend is running: `curl http://localhost:6363/health`
2. Check for port conflicts
3. Ensure CORS is working (check browser console for errors)

### Model not found error

If you see "ModelNotFoundError", the selected model may not be enabled:

1. Run `gemini settings` and check available models
2. Enable preview models if using Gemini 3

### Content extraction fails

Some pages block content scripts. The extension falls back to basic text extraction if Readability fails.

### Pin button not working

1. Check that the page allows content scripts (some pages like chrome:// or chrome-extension:// block them)
2. Look for errors in the browser console (F12)
3. Try refreshing the page and the extension

### Gemini Nano won't download / "not enough space"

The model isn't downloaded until you first try to use it — at that point Chrome needs ~25 GB free on the volume containing your Chrome profile (not total disk space). If there isn't enough room the download fails, and Chrome won't retry in the same session:

1. Free up ~25 GB on your Chrome profile volume (on macOS, usually your main volume).
2. **Quit Chrome completely and reopen it** — a reload won't retry the download.
3. Select `gemini-nano (on-device)` and send a message. The download kicks off at that point and takes a few minutes (~2 GB).

To check where things stand, open `chrome://on-device-internals` and look at the **Model Status** and **Event Logs** tabs. You can also check from DevTools on the side panel page:

```js
await LanguageModel.availability();
// → "available" | "downloading" | "downloadable" | "unavailable"
```

`"downloadable"` means the hardware supports it but the model hasn't been fetched yet. `"unavailable"` is a harder block — GPU memory or other hardware constraints — the event logs will say which.

### Sessions not loading

The extension automatically migrates from the old single-session storage format (v0.0.1) to the new multi-session format (v0.1.0+). If you experience issues:

1. Check browser console for migration errors
2. Your old session should appear in the sessions list
3. If migration fails, old data is preserved at `chrome.storage.local.lloro_session`

## Development

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```

### Extension

After making changes to extension files:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Click the refresh icon on the extension card
